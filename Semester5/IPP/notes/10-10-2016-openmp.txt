Back to the trapezoid rule:
    computing each trapezoid and then add ing htem together. 
    what is the trapezoid rule?
        Waited ~2 minutes
        -Parllel task, embarassingly parallel, threads execute with no communicaiton
            have to sync up at end to compute a sum
        -Might have to assign multiple trapezoids to threads to cover the whole regoin
        -Global result needs to be protected with a critical section
            #pragma omp critical global_result += my_result;

        What does this do? (Code) SLIDE 33
            Waited ~2 minutes
            -We compute the global result and then add it to the global result after
                setting as a critical section
            -Does taht make sense? Can everyone handle this?
        
        What does main do?
            Waited 30 seconds
            -Gets info I need and then this code will execute in parallel on how many threads i told you 
                to run it
        After it runs what happens?
            -Prints out the results on the main thread 
            -There is an impolicit sync point at "Trap" 
            -Most of the threads go away leaving hte master thread to execute to the end.
            Any questions? Does this make sense?
    


        How can we make it better?
            Does that make sense?
        
            We can do better by adding a reduction clause to a parallel directive
