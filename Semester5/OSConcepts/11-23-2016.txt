File system is an abstractino for persistent storage
-Hidden(Implementation) and -Emphasize(Interface)

    -When we say file we mean any kind of file. Text, source, binary, image files, multimedia
    Q: WHy is it a file?
    A: Because it is persistantly stored


Per process ther eis a table and open files

Shated(I have no idea what he wrote) Open files table (OS)

-When a process opesn a file it gets a handle
printf("%d", fopen());


Okay so if you have something called an open file, this kindof analogous to a running process
excpet it is not running. There is a valid handle in one of the processes and its entry is on 
the open file table

-As soon as you have an open file the OS maintains a few things"
    1. File pointer standard hting in C
    2. File open count
    3. Disk locaiton - the os needs to know where it is on the disk so the OS can go fetch it
    4. access to rights

    Locks if it is shared or if its exclusive. Usualy do not have race conditions on this one
        You can create shared memeory to have procesess to exchange info by having a shared ifle


    Q: What is the file open count? and why do I need it
    Q: Why do you need to know how many times it has been opened?
    A: I didnt listen to the answer ROFL

How to access a file
-Sequential     -Direct         -INdexed

=Sequential: How does a process get access to a file. A process cannot acces anything on disk without
    going throuhg a framed page
    You do a file pointer in OS memory to go here to make a load request to access the file dequentially
