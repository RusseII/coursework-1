What we still have to learn

-----SCHEDULING------
-Processes and Threads
---------------
-Disk Scheduling


-----PROJECT PRESENTATIONS------
-5 to 7 minutes
-2 or 3 person teams
-Exepctation:
    -Each team goes above and beyond the material taight in the class and you 
         find something ofd your interest that is contemporary
    -Go find your passion, something of interst to you, in the world around you
    -"hey this is an operating system"
        -Don't get caight up in a huge buly thing
        -Any size
        -Any domain of interst
        -Find a REAL operating system

            -How does it manage
                -Storage
                -Resources
                -connectivity
                -files
        -Hey this guy has looked at a memory management as a dining philosphers problem
        -Connect it to class
        -Don't come back with something dumb like 512 bytes of this this many save registers

        -We want to know hwo they do process management 
        -CONNECT BACK TO CLASS -- This is an importatn part of your grade


    -Do something novel
        Not windowsNT and linux



----ANOTHER PROJECT THING----
-Ethics




----Scheduler---- it makes choices ( there is more than one way to choose and diff reasons to choose )
    -Makes choices about what porcess to execute next
    -Does it through the Scheduling algorithm
    -Looks at the ready queue because that is where the processes are that need scheduled. 

    -Lots of variatons of these fellows
        -Short term: Estimate the next cpu burst. Algo tries to estimate based on past history
        -Long term schedulers: Job parameters (here is a process that takes x seconds to compute and you can do stuff with it)
        -Batch schedulers: Throughput is all they are concerend with. Need to know u, resonse time
            Depending on what you are ytryin to minimiize the scheudler wil lbe different
        -Real time scheudler: Hard realtime system. Response time
        -ONline: Fairness

    

    CONTEXT SWITCH
    :Change user mode to kernel mode
        -Save state P0
        -Run scheudler to select Pi
        -Resore Pi


    Why does Cache work?
        -Principle of Locality
            -Everything is close by that you need
            -Workd with data and instructions
                    -Data=95%    -Instruction=99%

    When do I need to schedule
        -new process created
        -process terminated
        -process sliced out
        
        -process blocks (IO, semaphore, resoiuce)

        -IO/interupt

    
    Premtable: 
        preemption vs non preemption
        
        -Preemption means process switch and the end result is fien
        -A process that is not preemptables output does not produce the same output after interrruptino

        -The most time we are going to deal with preemptive software
        -Some resouces are not preemtable
